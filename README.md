# 🧠 **Dexora: Unified AI Knowledge Platform**

### ⚡ Powered by **Cerebras | Meta Llama | Docker | Kafka | Neo4j | Apache NiFi**

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

Across every enterprise today, data lives in silos — PDFs, spreadsheets, screenshots, SharePoint exports, emails, and call notes.
Each department has its own system, its own formats, and no unified way to access knowledge.

The result? Hours wasted searching for files, repetitive work, and inconsistent decision-making.

**Dexora** redefines this chaos through a **Unified AI Knowledge Platform** — a single intelligent layer that consolidates every format, every data stream, and every department into one self-learning ecosystem.
